# TaskManager Web Application

## Overview
The Task Manager is a simple, single-page web application that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, edit task descriptions, and delete tasks. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it leverages DOM manipulation and the Browser Object Model (BOM) to provide a dynamic user experience.

## Features
- **Add New Tasks:** Users can add tasks to the list using a form input field and the "Add Task" button.
- **Complete Tasks:** Users can toggle the completion status of tasks. Completed tasks are visually distinguished with a green background.
- **Edit Tasks:** Users can edit the description of a task using a prompt.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can delete tasks from the list.
- **Local Storage:** The application saves the task list in the browser's local storage, so the tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.
- **Dynamic UI:** The UI updates in real-time as tasks are added, edited, completed, or deleted.
- **Form Validation:** The task input field includes both HTML attribute validation (e.g., required, maxlength) and DOM-event-driven validation to ensure that tasks are not empty.
